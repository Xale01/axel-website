# axel-website
This is a website that I'm currently developping for my roomemates and myself, in order to create like a "dashboard" for our appartment.
This project will probably evolve in the future !

# What are the technologies used ?
Here is a list of what am I using for developping this :  
- PHP Laravel with Blade and Tailwind
- My local home-made server to host the website
# What about now ?
If you're interested in seeing more (or maybe you just wanna date me, idk), here is my [portfolio](https://xale01.github.io/xale01/)  
Thankss <3
